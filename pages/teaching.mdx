Here are some courses I've either taught or still teach across different faculties of the University of Porto, but mainly in the Faculty of Sciences. I teach in the areas of Photogrammetry, Topographic Cartography and Geographic Information Systems (Bachelor in Geospatial Engineering, Master in Surveying Engineering and Master in Remote Sensing).
